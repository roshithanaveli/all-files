location
---------
In AngularJS, a service is a function, or object, that is available for, and limited to, 
your AngularJS application.

AngularJS has about 30 built-in services. One of them is the $location service.

The $location service has methods which return information about the 
location of the current web page

http
-----

The $http service is one of the most common used services in AngularJS applications. 
The service makes a request to the server, and lets your application handle the response.


<html>
<script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/angularjs/1.6.9/angular.min.js"></script>
<body>

<div ng-app="myApp" ng-controller="myCtrl"> 

<p>Today's welcome message is:</p>

<h1>{{myWelcome}}</h1>

</div>

<p>The $http service requests a page on the server, and the response is set as the value of the "myWelcome" variable.</p>

<script>
var app = angular.module('myApp', []);
app.controller('myCtrl', function($scope, $http) {
  $http.get("welcome.htm").then(function (response) {
      $scope.myWelcome = response.data;
  });
});
</script>

</body>
